~~~~~~~~ Testing to export your data as a csv (5) ~~~~~~~~
    Please check completed data
    Same data as inputted above was check to have the smae output as print statement
    Not included here to keep test suite small (like it said in the Team Project Progress Report 4)
    
~~~~~~~~ Testing to export your data as a geo package (6) ~~~~~~~~
    Please check completed data
    Same data as inputted above was check to have the smae output as print statement and visaully checked in arcgis
    Not included here to keep test suite small (like it said in the Team Project Progress Report 4)

~~~~~~~~ Testing to create and view your map (7) ~~~~~~~~
    Please check completed data
    Checked aganist model in arcgis and popup checked against above ouput
    Not included here to keep test suite small (like it said in the Team Project Progress Report 4)
    
    Please note for the last 3 things we tested a mutiple differnt combinations of the above output and made sure we got the same numbers every time
    We also checked aganist mutiple times
